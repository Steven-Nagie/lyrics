-- Transition to bigger size and slide to middle to get cool effect like it's appearing from out of the menu.

HTML
1. Have to include copyright info on any page displaying lyrics.
--See checklist, but track.lyrics.get will include lyrics_copyright
2. Rainbow effect if you click the lyrics text

API
1. It is required to put the specific id for a song in order to get the lyrics.
2. Tracking code, see track-lyrics-get documentation
Ask user for which country they would like to play in, then get the 50 most popular artists in that country
--Specific options, since the api is limited to a certain number of countries.
--See chart.artist.get or chart.tracks.get

STRETCH GOALS
1. Include images of album cover art (maybe do this for the possible answers)
5. Opaque flag of country on hover in home screen
6. Video background on home screen (different video for each load would be cool)
-- See code Steven sent.
7. Erase questions from tracks array as they are done so they don't repeat.
8. Correct answer bounces when you click.
-- Just write a jQuery function that does this, then invoke it in the correctAnswer function.


BIG STRETCH
4. Include translated versions of name somehow
-- Maybe just do the whole Japanese version in Japanese as an easter egg
3. You can sort artists by popularity. See https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/input-parameters for details. This could be used to change difficulties.
2. Use explicit flags to find songs with most swear words?
--Alternatively, write a jQuery function to do that, since the explicit flag only identifies yes/no, a song does or does not have explicit lyrics.
7. Have 'streak game', where you simply go until you're wrong, try to get the high score
