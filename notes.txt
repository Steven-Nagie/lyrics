1. Have to include copyright info on any page displaying lyrics.

API
1. It is required to put the specific id for a song in order to get the lyrics.
2. Tracking code, see track-lyrics-get documentation
Ask user for which country they would like to play in, then get the 50 most popular artists in that country

Stretch Goals
1. Use explicit flags to find songs with most swear words?
--Alternatively, write a jQuery function to do that, since the explicit flag only identifies yes/no, a song does or does not have explicit lyrics.
2. You can sort artists by popularity. See https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/input-parameters for details. This could be used to change difficulties.
